// notes about how 

"{ write me a rust command line program  \
it must use the clap crate to parse command line arguments \
it must use the crate tiktoken-rs to count the number of tokens in text \
the text is either passed in as a file with a -f argument,  \
or passed in via stdin \
it must have an argument that allows the user to select the encoding for tiktoken-rs \
it must use the c100k_base encoding by default}"
