write me a rust command line program 
it must use the clap crate to parse command line arguments 
it must use the crate tiktoken-rs to count the number of tokens in text 
the text is either passed in as a file with a -f argument,
or passed in via stdin 
it must have an argument that allows the user to select the encoding for tiktoken-rs 
it must use the c100k_base encoding by default
provide me only the main.rs code with no extra text
avoid using the crate anyhow
use the following method of declaring options:
#[derive(Parser, Clone)]
#[clap(
    version = "1.0",
    author = "Tenkai Kariya",
    about = "Interactive chat with GPT"
)]
pub struct Opts {
    #[clap(short = 'n', long = "new", help = "Start a new chat session")]
    pub new: bool,

    #[clap(
        short = 'm',
        long = "model",
        value_name = "MODEL_NAME",
        help = "Specify the model to use (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k)"
    )]
    pub model: Option<String>,
}
