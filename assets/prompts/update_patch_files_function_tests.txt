update the patch_files_function_tests.rs file with the updated code that is in the patch_files_function.rs file

Make sure that you do not leave any placeholders when you are finished with the code.
Make sure that all tests will pass.
Make sure you use the most idiomatic rust you know.
Make sure that the command will integrate with the rest of the application after you are finished, in the way it currently does now.
Make sure that you double check all line numbers before applying changes using the git_apply function.
Do not ask me any questions about what to do next, just make your best guess and proceed, and continue without prompting me until you finish.
Before creating a file, check to see if it exists first and if it does, use apply_patch function to update it instead.
Do not update me with your plan or with status, just execute the prompt without any further communication unless absolutely necessary
