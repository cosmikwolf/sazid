# The Goal:
implement a generic function call definition where commands will be defined in a TOML file

# Context:
We are developing a CLI application in Rust that accesses GPT
the application has various function calls that provide GPT access with access to command line programs.

These files contain the function calls I have already defined.
- create_file_function.rs
- pcre2grep_function.rs
- patch_files_function.rs

Currently, each function_call requires a new source file to hard code the function logic

# Steps
  - Read the 3 provided files
  - Create a plan to achieve the goal
    1. Designate file paths for any files that will be generated by this plan
    2. Create a list of all function signatures that will end up in the source
  - Create a new prompt file that contains this plan
    1. Include instructions that will ensure that GPT will follow the code requirements below

# Code Requirements
  - The new function must integrate with the existing application in the same way the existing functions do.
  - They should allow the user to define a subset of arguments that the GPT app can pass to the function call
  - Ensure you write all code in idiomatic rust.
  - Ensure you write tests for your code.
  - Ensure the code will compile
  - Ensure the code is well documented
  - Ensure you provide complete comprehensive code
  - DO NOT PROVIDE ANY PLACEHOLDERS.
  - Complete all code and complete the request in its entirety in as few steps as possible
  - Write any intermediate files in .session_data
  - Only write the completed source into ./src/app/functions and ./tests
  - DO NOT UPDATE ME ON YOUR PROGRESS.
  - Create files with the create_file command
  - overwrite existing files by using overwrite:true
  - respond with either file changes, or a request for more information, or a status message that is at most 5 words long.
