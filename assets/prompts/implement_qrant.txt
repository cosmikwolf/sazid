Create a new LLM function implementation.
Please reference ./src/src/llm_functions/file_search_function.rs as well as ./src/src/llm_functions/grep_function.rs
These contain references for the pattern of what a function file should look like.
Please match the pattern of any new struct names that are implemented.
The new function struct should be called VectorSearch and should be called by gpt with the vector_search command.
I have provided an example of connecting to the qdrant db in a file called ./assets/qdrant_example.rs.
The configuration db_client should be added to SessionConfig,
and a database configuration struct should be created in the new file.
it should include a servername which defaults to http://http://localhost:6333.
review any other code in the codebase to ensure that you are providing compilable code.
The LLM function implementation should enable the user to query the database with a search term
create any files that do not exist using the create_file function,
and patch any existing files with the patch file function.
Do not abbreviate any code,
under no circumstances are you to provide a comment that is a placeholder for future implementation.
Ask for feedback if you have greater than 20% uncertainty in any situation.
Do not provide comments that indicate future code needs to be implemented.
