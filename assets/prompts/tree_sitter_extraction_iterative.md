# Iterative Approach for Tree-sitter Code Extraction

Create Rust code to parse Rust source code with Tree-sitter and iteratively extract elements for a vector database. The code will enhance GPT's understanding of the codebase.

## Iterations

### Iteration 1: Basic Setup and Comment Extraction
- Setup Tree-sitter and Rust grammar.
- Parse a single Rust file and extract documentation comments.
- Serialize comments into a structured format (e.g., JSON).

### Iteration 2: Declaration Extraction
- Extend the parsing to include function, struct, enum, and trait declarations.
- Extract names, visibility, signatures, and associate doc comments.
- Update serialization format to include declarations.

### Iteration 3: In-depth Code Constructs
- Parse implementations, definitions, and variable usages.
- Extract control structures like `if`, `match`, loops.
- Include literals, non-doc comments, attributes, macros.
- Serialize the new constructs, enhancing the structured format.

### Iteration 4: Data Representation for ML
- Decide on a vector representation for each code construct.
- Consider context, scope, and relationships for embeddings.
- Use or create a machine learning model for vector generation.

### Iteration 5: Database Schema and Storage
- Design a database schema suitable for vector data.
- Implement database storage for serialized code constructs.
- Ensure efficient querying and indexing.

### Iteration 6: Refinement and Testing
- Test the code with various Rust projects.
- Refine extraction and serialization processes based on feedback.
- Optimize database interactions.

## Final Steps
Compile the iterations into a complete Rust application that:

1. Reads `Cargo.toml` to locate library paths.
2. Uses Tree-sitter to parse source code and extract elements iteratively.
3. Serializes extracted data for database ingestion.
4. Generates vector embeddings for machine learning.
5. Stores data in a database following the designed schema.
