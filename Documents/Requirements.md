### **Sazid: An Interactive GPT Chat Application**

#### **Functional Requirements**:

1. **GPT Integration**:
    - Utilize the `async_openai` library to integrate with OpenAI's GPT model.
    - Establish a connection to the GPT API using provided API keys from the environment.
    - Send user messages to the GPT model and retrieve generated responses.
    - Handle different message roles, specifically User and Assistant.

2. **Chat Session Management**:
    - Provide command-line options to:
        - Start a new chat session (`-n` or `--new` flag).
        - Continue a previously stored session (`-c` or `--continue` flag with the session file as an argument).
    - Save chat sessions within the `session_data` directory, ensuring the data is structured into sub-directories like `ingested` and `processed`.
    - Automatically pick the latest session if no specific session is mentioned by the user.
    - Store the last-used session's filename in a text file named `last_session.txt`.
    - Delete a specific session if needed.

3. **File Ingestion and Data Logging**:
    - Implement an ingestion mechanism to handle files provided by the user.
    - Ensure the ingested files are stored in the `session_data/ingested` directory.
    - Log details of the ingested data in a structured format, including chunk numbers and file paths.
    - Store the ingested files with a naming convention that includes the session ID for easy identification.

4. **User Interaction**:
    - Implement a command-line interface for users to interact with the application.
    - Accept user input for messages to be sent to GPT.
    - Allow session exit using the command "exit", "quit", or `Ctrl+C`.
    - Implement an import feature to process specified files or directories (using the `-i` or `--import` flag followed by the file or directory path).

5. **Message Display**:
    - Display messages in the command-line interface with clear distinction between user and GPT messages.
    - Color-code GPT messages in green for easy differentiation.
    - Display a startup message when the application begins.
    - Provide exit messages when the application terminates.
    - Display import-related messages to inform the user of the import process status, including success, failure, or skipped statuses.

6. **File Chunking and Processing**:
    - Process various file types, including PDFs and text files.
    - Extract content from PDFs, keeping track of pages and any extraction errors.
    - For text files, chunk the content line by line.
    - For binary files, detect their type and provide appropriate messages.
    - For PDF files, detect their type and extract text content as needed.
    - Inform the user if a provided file appears to be binary and cannot be processed.

7. **Command-line Interface**:
    - Implement a robust command-line argument system using the `clap` library.
    - Provide flags to allow users to:
        - Start a new chat session (`-n` or `--new`).
        - Continue a specific session (`-c` or `--continue`).
        - Import a file or directory for processing (`-i` or `--import`).
    - Display version, author, and other metadata information when queried.

8. **Data Serialization and Storage**:
    - Serialize chat messages in JSON format for storage in session files.
    - Ensure that each message stored consists of:
        - Role (User or Assistant).
        - Content of the message.
    - Deserialize JSON data when loading from session files.

9. **Timestamp and Random Hash Management**:
    - Generate timestamps based on the system's local time.
    - Use the `rand` library to create random hashes for session filenames.
    - Utilize timestamps and random hashes for naming session files.

10. **Modularity and Code Structure**:
    - Modularize functionalities into distinct modules:
        - GPT Integration.
        - Session Management.
        - User Interface.
        - File Chunking.
        - PDF Text Extraction.
    - Ensure that each module has dedicated functionality and minimizes dependencies on other modules.

#### **Non-functional Requirements**:

1. **Scalability**:
    - Design the application to efficiently handle multiple users without degrading performance.

2. **Responsiveness**:
    - Ensure prompt feedback to user input and provide timely GPT responses.

3. **Maintainability**:
    - Maintain a well-organized and documented codebase, enabling straightforward future modifications.

4. **Security**:
    - Do not hardcode API keys; instead, securely manage them using environment variables.
    - Implement safety measures to prevent unauthorized access to stored chat sessions.

5. **Reliability**:
    - Incorporate mechanisms to recover from potential crashes, ensuring continued operations with minimal data loss.

6. **Portability**:
    - Design the application to be platform-independent, ensuring it runs on various operating systems without major alterations.

7. **Usability**:
    - Make the command-line interface intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring users can easily understand and follow instructions.

8. **Dependency Management**:
    - Rely on third-party libraries such as `rustyline`, `clap`, `async_openai`, `lopdf`, `serde_json`, `serde`, `chrono`, `rand`, and `owo_colors`. Ensure these libraries are maintained and updated as needed.

9. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement comprehensive error-handling mechanisms to address potential issues related to:
        - GPT API connections.
        - File read/write operations.
        - Session management.
        - File import processes.
    - Display user-friendly error messages, informing users about the nature of any encountered error.
