create a new function for my application.
the following files are examples of existing functions that are already defined:
./src/app/functions/cargo_check_function.rs
./src/app/functions/create_file_function.rs
./src/app/functions/patch_files_function.rs

Create the function in a new file using the patterns and conventions that are used in the files I referenced above.

The ModelFunction trait is defined in
./src/app/functions/function_call.rs

The function should:

call the terminal command: pcre2grep

it should have three arguments. options, pattern, paths
Each of these arguments should be a string in their command property.
options should be a comma separated list of pcre2grep options

in the code that parses the function arguments, it should match the options to options that are available in the pcre2grep mac command. below is the help text from the command.


below is the help text for the CLI. Please look at all of the options and determine which 10 options would be ideal to provide a GPT bot so it can search for text in files. This bot is a programming assistant that will be using this function to gain awareness of the code that exists in a codebase.

The bot should ensure that only the allowed options are parsed, and if GPT provides an invalid option, it should reply with the options that are available.

The bot should also ensure that only allowed paths are passed to the function, as it does the other functions of which the source I provided above.


Please analyze this request, and create a plan to implement this new function before taking action.



Usage: pcre2grep [OPTION]... [PATTERN] [FILE1 FILE2 ...]
Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.
PATTERN must be present if neither -e nor -f is used.
All callout scripts in patterns are supported.
"-" can be used as a file name to mean STDIN.
Files whose names end in .gz are read using zlib.
Files whose names end in .bz2 are read using bzlib2.
Other files and the standard input are read as plain files.

Example: pcre2grep -i 'hello.*world' menu.h main.c

The default value for --max-buffer-size is 1048576.

space is removed and blank lines are ignored.
The maximum size of any pattern is 8192 bytes.

With no FILEs, read standard input. If fewer than two FILEs given, assume -h.
Exit status is 0 if any matches, 1 if no matches, and 2 if trouble.
