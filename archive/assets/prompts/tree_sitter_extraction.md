# Tree-sitter Code Extraction for Vector Database

The goal is to create Rust code that uses the Tree-sitter library to parse a Rust project's source code and extract various syntactic and semantic elements.
These elements will be used to populate a vector database, enhancing the understanding of the codebase for machine learning models.

## Requirements

- Install Tree-sitter and the Rust grammar for Tree-sitter.
- Traverse the syntax tree to identify important code constructs including:
  - Documentation comments
  - Function, struct, enum, and trait declarations
  - Implementations and definitions
  - Variable usages and function calls
  - Control structures like `if`, `match`, and loops
  - Literals, non-doc comments, attributes, and macros
- Extract the above constructs and serialize them into a structured format.
- Consider how to represent each construct as vectors for machine learning purposes.
- Design a schema for storing these vectors in a database, considering efficient querying and indexing.
- Take into account any special handling for macros, attributes, and lifetimes, as they affect code structure and semantics.

## Instructions

Develop Rust code that performs the following steps:

1. Read the project's `Cargo.toml` using the `toml` crate to identify library paths.
2. Use Tree-sitter with the Rust grammar to parse each library's source code.
3. Implement functions to traverse the parsed syntax tree and extract the required elements listed above.
4. Serialize the extracted data into a format that can be ingested by a vector database.
5. Optionally, create a machine learning model or use an existing one to generate vector embeddings from the extracted code elements.
6. Write the serialized data and possibly the embeddings into the designed schema in the database.
7. Save this code to a file in ./src/app/embeddings/

The code should be well-documented, with clear explanations for each function and module, to ensure maintainability and ease of understanding.
