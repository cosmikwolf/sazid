It's basically a jumble of popular internet acronyms \"OMG\" (Oh my God) and \"WTF\" (what the f***). The inclusion of \"BBQ\" (barbeque) doesn't really mean anything and is used jokingly to add to the randomness of the phrase. It can be used in response to something extremely surprising or confusing.","function_call":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}}]}
