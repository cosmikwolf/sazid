It causes sudden, rapid movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics) that people cannot control. These tics may include movements like blinking, shrugging, jerking, or making inappropriate gestures, and sounds like grunting, clearing the throat, or shouting obscenities.\n\nTS is an inherited disorder and usually starts in childhood. While the exact cause is unknown, it appears to be linked to changes in the brain and problems with how nerve cells communicate. It is likely that the condition is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nGene mutations seem to play a role in causing TS, but they are not the only factor involved. Genetics may increase a person's risk of developing the condition and also influence its severity, but the exact pattern of inheritance is not fully understood.\n\nThe syndrome is more common in boys than girls, and symptoms often improve as children grow older. While there is no cure for TS, there are treatments available that can help to manage the symptoms. These can include medication, psychotherapy, and relaxation techniques to help control tics and reduce the stress and anxiety associated with them. Some people with TS will also have other health problems like ADHD and OCD which may require additional treatment. It is important to remember that people with TS can live healthy, productive lives with the appropriate treatment and support.","function_call":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}}]}
