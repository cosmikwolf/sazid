## IDEAS

- Summarize Project Files:
  - get a list of all the files in the Project
  - for each file:
      - if it is short enough to fit in half of a context
      - get properties:
        - List of function signatures
        -



## Problems
- App seems to freeze for a second after submitting input, before going into processing mode
- when calling a function, if an error is reached, the app should go back to input mode

## To Do List:

- Create Grep Function
- Create "worker session"  functions
  - that use pre-configured prompts and functions to execute complex, repetetive tasks
  - including:
    - Summarize Project
      - Find All custom datatypes in a Project
        - Create a directory for each datatype
        - List all instantiations of custom dataype
        - List all methods described for that filetype
          - Summarize each method
          - List places where that method was called
          - The file and line number for each method
        - List all datatypes that are used by Custom datatype
        - A list of all other datatypes that are associated
      - a list of all variables that may be accessed from outside of the function they are used in
      - Evaluate implementation
        - Evaluate architectural separations
      - Create a C4 diagram of the component
        - Generate mermaid.js diagram based on code
    - Research Library
      - Retrieve source code for Library
      - list all publically accessible functions, methods, dataypes, enums, constants
    - Validate and Evaluate Code



## notes
- calling multiple functions in one request:
   - https://community.openai.com/t/emulated-multi-function-calls-within-one-request/269582

-- API failures: need to handle these so they present user errors
  -- error 400
    -- invalid request, also server errors
  -- error 401
    - invalid api key
  -- error 429
    - too many requests
